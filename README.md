# Module2-VBA
Module 2 Challenge 2 HW 
Got help from AskBCS LA Dinh. He helped me with the starter code and helped me with the for loop. 
Also got help from some stackoverflow websites to help with the column headers (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62471422/vba-loop-how-to-get-ticker-symbols-into-ticker-column)
Got help from a microsoft website to help with getting the code to run across all the worksheets (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/macro-to-loop-through-all-worksheets-in-a-workbook-feef14e3-97cf-00e2-538b-5da40186e2b0)
Used this website to get the last row (https://www.teachexcel.com/excel-tutorial/get-the-last-row-using-vba-in-excel_1745.html)
